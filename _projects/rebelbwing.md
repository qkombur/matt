title: "Rebel B-Wing"
body: "This is the last (full-size) 3-3/4"-scale vehicle I've made to date.  This is a wooden B-Wing that I'm making for my 3rd nephew.  It features:  Foldable and lockable wings, and a rotating cockpit.  I may add landing gear and perhaps spring-loaded lasers/missiles later."
