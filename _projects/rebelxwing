title: "Rebel X-Wing"
body:"This is my second 3-3/4" (full scale) vehicle.  It is a wooden Rebel X-Wing.  It is another project that I'm doing solely for another nephew, but I like to show off my toy-making prowess.  It features a hinged canopy, pulley-activated wings, a hinged back door,and eventually landing gear.  I will update the progress soon, as it is further along thatn what's shown."
